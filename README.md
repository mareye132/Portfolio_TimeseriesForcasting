# Portfolio_TimeseriesForcasting
Objectives
The objective of this challenge is to equip trainees with the skills needed to preprocess financial data, develop time series forecasting models, analyze market trends, and optimize investment portfolios. Participants will gain practical experience in leveraging data-driven insights to enhance portfolio performance, minimize risks, and capitalize on market opportunities.

Task 1: Preprocess and Explore the Data
Overview
In Task 1, the goal is to load, clean, and understand the data to prepare it for modeling. This includes data extraction, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and initial insights into financial trends and volatility.

Key Steps
Data Extraction:

Utilize YFinance to extract historical financial data for:
TSLA (Tesla): High potential returns with significant volatility.
BND (Bond ETF): Offers stability and low risk.
SPY (S&P 500 ETF): Provides diversified, moderate-risk market exposure.
Data Cleaning and Understanding:

Review basic statistics to understand data distribution.
Verify appropriate data types and check for any missing values.
Handle missing values through filling, interpolation, or removal as needed.
Normalize or scale the data if required, particularly for machine learning applications.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the closing prices over time to detect trends and patterns.
Compute and plot the daily percentage changes to observe volatility.
Analyze volatility by calculating rolling means and standard deviations to identify short-term trends.
Detect outliers and identify days with significant anomalies, focusing on unusually high or low returns.
Seasonality and Trends:

Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components for deeper insight.
Volatility Analysis:

Calculate rolling averages and standard deviations to understand and document short-term trends and volatility.
Key Insights:

Summarize observations such as Tesla's overall price direction, fluctuations in daily returns, and their impact.
Assess potential losses and risk-adjusted returns using Value at Risk (VaR) and the Sharpe Ratio.
